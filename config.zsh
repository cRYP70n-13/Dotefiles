# problem: when presenting, I want to obscure
# my prompt to act like it's at root of file system
# and be very basic with no git info, etc.

# solution: this theme lets you set a ENV to the path
# of your presentation, which will help remove unneeded prompt
# features while in that path

# oh-my-zsh theme for presenting demos
# based off the default rubbyrussell theme
# save this in .oh-my-zsh/custom/themes/present.zsh-theme
# then make this your default theme in .zshrc and it will
# act normal until you set the ENV VAR 'PRESENT' to a full path
# to the folder you want to present from. This will then hide
# the current working dir name in your prompt while in that dir only
# and hide the git_prompt for it and all subdirs
# mine has a whale emote for all things docker
# simply unset the PRESENT to clear config
# example:
# cd path/to/my/code/repo/for/presentation
# export PRESENT=$(PWD)


# if PRESENT has been set, lets show whale
# if not, DAY DRINKING!
